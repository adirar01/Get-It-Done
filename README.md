# Get It Done!

## An all-in-one productivity manager for everyone!

This productivity manager allows its users to *login*, *schedule and keep track of tasks*, and make use 
of the included *Pomodoro Timer* to maximize their workflow efficiency. 
The goal of the application is to provide its users ease and reduce the added stress 
of keeping up and managing everything they need to do. The application is designed for 
students, working professionals, creatives -- anyone who has work they need to do! <br>

I decided to create **Get It Done** because I see a need for it in my own life. It's said 
that necessity is the mother of invention and that holds very true for this project. Ultimately, I'd like to 
see the application have a positive impact in the lives of all its users.
